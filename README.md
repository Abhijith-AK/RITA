# RITA (Ṛta)

RITA is a cognitive operating system designed to act across software,
devices, and environments using a hybrid control strategy.

RITA does not depend on APIs alone.
It prefers structured access when available and falls back to
human-like system interaction when required.

---

## What RITA Is

• A hybrid personal and enterprise intelligence layer  
• An action-oriented system, not a chatbot  
• A controller that treats the digital world as an environment  
• A decision engine that chooses *how* to act, not just *what* to say  

---

## Core Principle

> If an API is available, RITA uses it.  
> If not, RITA performs the task manually using system-level
> perception and control.

---

## Example Capabilities

• Reading and summarizing emails  
• Drafting replies with human approval  
• Controlling applications via UI when APIs are unavailable  
• Acting across laptop and mobile environments  
• Logging and auditing every action  

---

## What RITA Is NOT

• Not a wrapper around OpenAI or any single model  
• Not an API-only automation bot  
• Not a voice assistant toy  
• Not vendor-locked  

---

## Architecture (High Level)

Intent  
→ Capability Resolution  
→ Strategy Selection (API / System / Manual)  
→ Action Execution  
→ Memory & Logs  

---

## Project Status

RITA is in early development.
Current focus is on building the core decision and capability
resolution engine before adding intelligence layers.

---

## Philosophy

RITA is named after **Ṛta**, the Vedic concept of cosmic order.
The system is designed to impose structure, intention, and alignment
on complex digital environments.

## Roadmap (Short)

• Define intent and capability engine  
• Implement hybrid execution logic  
• Build one complete workflow (email handling)  
• Add perception-based fallback execution  
• Expand memory and policy layers
